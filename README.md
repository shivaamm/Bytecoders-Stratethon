## ❓ Problem Statement
When a patient is unable to take their medication, the effects can be devastating.

Our country is facing a healthcare affordability crisis that places the burden of high out-of-pocket costs on seriously ill patients, impeding adherence to their prescribed treatments. Patients often resort to cost-saving measures—such as cutting pills or delaying their next prescription refill—just to make ends meet.

## ✈ Solution
Medicines don't work if people don't take them. Today Medical nonadherence puts a huge burden on the already stressed healthcare ecosystem.
Are you not able to take medicines at the correct time?,  omitting one or multiple doses?, forgot to take an appointment?, Did not get a prescription refill? Don't Worry we got you covered.
